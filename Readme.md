# Equality Class Classification Project

This project is part of the Deloitte Certification Program. The main objective is to classify the "Equality Class" using the "Equality Scores" provided in the dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Original Data:** The team provided an Excel file named `Task Equality.xls`.
- **Data Conversion:** The Excel sheet was converted to a CSV file named `task_5.csv` for easier processing with pandas.
- **Reference:** A file named "Task 5 Model Answer" was provided as a reference for the classification logic.
- **Implementation:** The classification logic and the rest of the task are my own work.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x and pandas installed.
2. Place `task_5.csv` in the project folder.
3. Run the main script to classify the Equality Class.
